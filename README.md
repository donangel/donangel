### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ###

Welcome my public Github repos. Here's some more info about me, according to Github's requirements ðŸ˜ƒ

- ðŸ”­ In my free time, I work on various personal projects, primarily mobile apps on Dart/Flutter. I'm using this also as a tremendous learning opportunity.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via this profile. Or if you'd like more, you can [visit my About.Me page](https://about.me/donangel/), where you'll find all my profiles and contact information.

Last, but not least, here's my DailyDev card. I love it there, if you're not using it, maybe you should take a look:
